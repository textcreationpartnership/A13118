         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, how they that are willing to apprehend and a≈ø≈øi≈øt new bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈ø≈øes, are de≈øirous to be ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the≈øe points. Fir≈øt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the perfect and exact knowledge of that Inuention wherein they are to deale and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate, for as the common Prouerbe ≈øaith; <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido.</hi> The ≈øecond is, touching the worth and goodne≈ø≈øe of the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and how the benefit thereof may bee rai≈øed. The third is the habillity of the Inuentioner, to effect and performe his proiect propounded. The fourth is concerning the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting or bargaining; In all which, I will endeauour to giue the be≈øt ≈øatisfaction that I may, out of the praecepts and grounds of this pre≈øent Treati≈øe of <hi>Metallica.</hi> And therefore concerning the fir≈øt point. The Tran≈øcript of his Maie≈øties mo≈øt gratious grant and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth euidently ≈øhew and informe the Reader, that among≈øt many other inuentions
<pb facs="tcp:18513:3"/>granted for one and thirty yeares, my Selfe, my Executors, Deputies and A≈ø≈øignes, may <hi>onely</hi> make, practi≈øe, and put in v≈øe, within any of his Maie≈øties Realmes and Dominions, the working, melting, and effecting of Iron, Steele, and other Mettles with Sea-coale, or Pit-coale. The principall end of which inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that the Woods and Timber of our country might be ≈øaued, maintained and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerued from the great con≈øumption and wa≈øte of our common Furnaces and Iron-Milnes, which as they are now ordinarily built and framed, can burne, ≈øpend, and con≈øume no other fewell but Char coale. The which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui≈øe if it may bee effected accordingly (as I make no doubt but by Gods ble≈ø≈øing I ≈øhall) will prooue to bee the be≈øt and mo≈øt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table bu≈øine≈ø≈øe and Inuention that euer was knowne or inuented in England the≈øe many yeares.</p>
            <p>For (to ≈øpeake nothing of the great benefit, and profit which may bee rai≈øed and made by twenty other Inuentions compri≈øed and
<pb facs="tcp:18513:3"/>comprehended vnder the Pattent) the yearly vallew of this mettle-bu≈øine≈ø≈øe alone, will amount vnto 330. thou≈øand pounds, <hi>per annu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,</hi> after the ≈øecond or third yeare, as appeareth by this calculation.</p>
            <div type="calculation">
               <head>A Calculation ≈øhewing how the <hi>Mettle Inuention</hi> or Art, which maketh all kinde of Mettles or Metalique ≈øubstance, with Pit-coale or Sea-coale, will bee worth <hi>per annum. 330.</hi> thou≈øand pounds, immediatly after the two fir≈øt yeares, which are the allotted times for Tryalls and Conformities, without any charges, (except the charges of Tryalls) to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees, Partners, A≈øsi≈øtants, and Dealers.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are planted already in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Wales, eight hundred Milnes for the making of Iron, for there are foure hundred Milnes in Surry, Kent, &amp; Su≈ø≈øex,
<pb facs="tcp:18513:4"/>as the towne≈ømen of Ha≈ølemore haue te≈øtified and numbred vnto mee, there are al≈øo 200. Milnes in Wales, and 20. in Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire, as the Author hath beene credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>Now wee may well ≈øuppo≈øe, that all Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland and Ireland (be≈øides the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named ≈øhires) will make vp the number of 180. Milnes more, being in all 800. Milnes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer one Milne alone ≈øpendeth year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Charcoale 500. pound and more, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer≈øe Clarkes and workmen in Iron bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, haue credibly te≈øtified, which in pit-coale will be done with the charges of 30. or 40. pounds, after the Inuentioners manner and inuention, or at the mo≈øt with 50. pound, where carriage is farre and chargeable.</p>
               <p>So that this new Inuention in the 800. Iron milnes, will ≈øaue and gaine <hi>de claro</hi> the owners of tho≈øe milnes 320. thou≈øand pounds yearly, ouer and aboue their ordinary and annuall gaines, as it appeareth by this proportion.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18513:4"/>
               <p> One Milne alone ≈øaueth yearely 400. li. <hi>Ergo,</hi> 800. Milnes ≈øaue yearly 320. thou≈øand pounds.</p>
               <p>Againe the ≈øaid <hi>Metalique</hi> inuention, beeing put and conuerted to Lead, Tinne, Copper, Bra≈ø≈øe, and Gla≈ø≈øe-mettle, in all the ≈øeuerall Mineralls of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, will que≈øtionle≈ø≈øe cleare yearely, by meanes of Fewell, aboue ten thou≈øand pounds more; ouer and be≈øides the ordinary gaines in the ≈øaid bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. So that the yearely Iron reuenues, added vnto the≈øe other <hi>Metalique</hi> reuenues, doe amount vnto 330. thou≈øand pounds, as was ≈øaid before.</p>
               <p>Now out of the≈øe <hi>Metalique</hi> gaines of 330. thou≈øand pounds yearely, the owners of the Milnes, Hearths, and Furnaces, may haue and receiue liberall rates and proportions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and allotted vnto them, ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides their ordinary gaines, onely in lieu of conforming their Furnaces, Fineries and Chafferies to this Inuention of Pitt-coale
<pb facs="tcp:18513:5"/>and Earth-coale. And al≈øo the Kings mo≈øt excellent Maie≈øtie, the Prince his Highne≈ø≈øe, the Duke of Yorke, the Lord Vicount Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che≈øter, and other parties interre≈ø≈øed in the Pattent, may by their Compo≈øition and agreement with the ≈øaid Owners and Iron-Mai≈øters, yearely receiue, by way of rents and licences, the re≈øidew of that gaines which remaineth ouer and aboue that which was allotted and allowed to the Iron-Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters, for applying of this Inuention to their ordinary way of making of Iron, as more fully ≈øhall bee ≈øpecified, ≈øhewed, and prooued in the Apendix of this Treati≈øe, which I am now preparing for the Printer and the Pre≈ø≈øe with all conuenient ≈øpeed.</p>
               <p>This may ≈øuffice therefore, to giue the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ≈øatisfaction, concerning the two fir≈øt points, for the knowledge and the worth of the bu≈øine≈ø≈øes, and concerning the manner how certaine yearly annuities may bee rai≈øed to the dealers and a≈ø≈øi≈øtants.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18513:5"/>
               <p> Now to per≈øwade the third point, that the Authour is able to effect the worke vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, in as ample manner as hee propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; wee plead and alledge as followeth.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt the Inuentioner by his ≈øtudy, indu≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and practi≈øe, hath already brought to pa≈ø≈øe and publi≈øhed diuer≈øe proiects and new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, a≈øwell Litterall as Mechannicall, very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to the common-wealth. His Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare Inuentions doe appeare and are knowne partly by his Printed Treati≈øe of <hi>Dibere Adam,</hi> which is a Schola≈øticall engin <hi>Aucomaton,</hi> and partly in diuer≈øe other Manu≈øcripts which he hath to ≈øhew. His new Mechanicks already performed, are to bee ≈øeene in the Inuentions which hee calleth by the names of <hi>Pre≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, Wood-pleits, Ballance, Engin, Baramyha,</hi> and <hi>Hubla,</hi> of all which in priuate ≈øpeech hee is ready more largely to conferre, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt their truth and goodne≈ø≈øe at his Worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hou≈øes at I≈ølington and Highbury. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.34. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> rea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the Beare and Lyon to Golyah the Gyant.</note> therefore he doubteth not but (by Gods ble≈ø≈øing &amp; a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, ≈øemblably with ≈øucce≈ø≈øe)
<pb facs="tcp:18513:6"/>to effect his Inuention of Iron-works, as al≈øo al his other <hi>Metallique</hi> deui≈øes and Inuentions, heere contained in the Patent, or Priuiledge of <hi>Metallica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly the con≈øideration of thinges in the like nature with it, are good inducements to per≈øwade vs well of this proiect, for Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, Brewing, Dying, Ca≈øting of Bra≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, &amp;c. were (not many yeares ≈øince) done altogether with the fuell of wood and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coale; in ≈øtead whereof Sea-coale is now v≈øed as effectually and to as good v≈øe and purpo≈øe. Againe (that which is ≈øomewhat neerer the marke) the Black≈ømith long agone forged all his Iron with Char-coale (as in ≈øome places where they are cheape they continue this cour≈øe ≈øtill) but the≈øe many yeares ≈ømall Sea-coale hath, and doth ≈øerue the turne, as well and ≈øufficiently. Adde heerevnto, that very lately by a wind-Furnace, greene gla≈ø≈øe, for windowes, is made as well with Pit-coale at Winche≈øter hou≈øe in Southwarke as it is done in other places with much wa≈øt &amp; con≈øuming
<pb facs="tcp:18513:6"/>of infinite ≈øtore of Billetts and other Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the Inuention hath already experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and made tryall of the cheife particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar meanes and In≈øtruments of diuers cheape waies of making of Irons in reall and ≈øub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall moddles to him-≈øelfe (though in ≈ømall things, according as his meanes would giue him leaue.) And this of his credit and hone≈øty he auoucheth and prote≈øteth: wherefore hee more confidently pre≈øumeth to worke the ≈øame effects in grander In≈øtruments and meanes of triall, after that hee hath receiued allowance of the dealers and a≈ø≈øi≈øtants for it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly there can bee no doubt of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the matter propounded, if the Inuentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can but make, or cau≈øe Sea-coale to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as ≈øeruiceable for <hi>Metallique</hi> purpo≈øes as wood &amp; Char-coale is: The art and ≈økill wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of con≈øi≈øteth cheifly in three points: The fir≈øt is to bring Earth-coale to that equallity of heat that Wood or Char-coale hath; That is to ≈øay, that it make neither hotter nor coulder

               <p>Now this three-fold mi≈øtery and ≈øecret, the Author can certainly performe and atchieue, by the powerfull efficacie and meanes of his dexterous prerogatiue in≈øtruments, deui≈øed for this purpo≈øe; as more at large is ≈øhewed, both in this Treati≈øe, and in the Apendix, which very ≈øhortly ≈øhall come forth, and al≈øo ≈øhall be further confirmed and iu≈øtified by his dayly experiments and tryals, which hee will bee ready to ≈øhew to them whom they ≈øhall any wayes touch or concerne, or to them who are otherwi≈øe de≈øirous to a≈ø≈øi≈øt and deale for the experimenting and accompli≈øhing of the≈øe ≈øo worthy good bu≈øine≈ø≈øes. And then

               <p>And thus (hauing briefly touched the≈øe foure premi≈øed points) I conclude and ≈øhut vp this Preface of Metallica. Humbly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly be≈øeeching the Lord, who by his holy ≈øpirit in≈øpired * <hi>Bezaleel,</hi>

               <p>A <hi>Heuretica</hi> in re≈øpect of the worke inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is diuided into two parts, namely, into the Scientiffick part and Mechanick part.</p>
               <p>R. 15. Define the Scientiffick part.</p>
               <p>A. The Scientiffick is that part of <hi>Heuretica</hi> which pre≈øcribeth prceepts generall to all liberall arts, the end of which Arts, is cheefely Science or knowledge and not any reall vi≈øible worke, or ≈øen≈øible thing.</p>
               <p>R. Define the Mechanick part.</p>
               <p>A. The Mechanick part is that part of <hi>Heuretica</hi> which pre≈øcribeth precepts generall to all illiberall arts, the end of which arts is cheefly a reall vi≈øible work or ≈øen≈øible thing.</p>
               <p>And the Inuention in this kind is called an Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Mechanick.</p>
               <p>R. 16. Define therefore an Inuention Mechanick.</p>
               <p>A. A Mechanick Inuention is the art of the Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which by effectuall In≈øtruments and meanes brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth ≈øome new vi≈øible or ≈øen≈øible worke good and profitable to the common-wealth.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:18513:34"/>
               <p> So the Inuention of printing is the ≈økill and art of <hi>Fau≈øtus Guttenbergius,</hi> which mi≈øtery (by the effectual deui≈øed means of the Pre≈ø≈øe, the Incke, the Characters and paper) bringeth forth impre≈ø≈øions and Bookes, which Mechanick workes are profitable and good for mans v≈øe.</p>
               <p>Where note, that, Fir≈øt the Mechanick Art, ≈øecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the In≈øtruments and meanes, thirdly the worke of the art, made by tho≈øe In≈øtruments, and meanes, are all called Mechanicks, and are all Inuentions in re≈øpect of the Author that deui≈øed them.</p>
               <p>R. 17. Expre≈ø≈øe further euery word and clau≈øe of this definition, to the intent that I may the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand them.</p>
               <p>A. Your de≈øire ≈øhall bee ≈øati≈øfied. Fir≈øt then to ≈øpeake of the thing defined, you mu≈øt note that any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, cour≈øe or way which bringeth forth no externall or Materiall worke, are al≈øo in re≈øpect of the Inuentor tearmed Inuentions.</p>
               <p>So the fir≈øt di≈øcouery of the we≈øt Indies by <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> (in re≈øpect of him) is fitly called his Inuention, and the turning point of Nauigation called the Cape of <hi>bona Speran√ßa</hi> is <hi>Gaymus</hi> his inuention the like may be ≈øaid of <hi>fretum Magellanicum,</hi> and <hi>fretum Dauies,</hi> which although they are laudable Inuentions, di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by ingenious &amp; venturous per≈øons, yet cannot they be ≈øaid to be Mecanicks. becau≈øe they produce or leaue behind them Mechanick work, nor had any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick in≈øtruments made by hands of man directly,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18513:35"/>and of purpo≈øe for the performance of them, for the≈øe Mechanicks are onely propper to the≈øe kinds of inuentions which wee treate of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 18. Wherefore call you an inuention a Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Arte.</p>
               <p>A. To put a di≈øtinction betweene the≈øe inuentions Mechanicall, and other inuentions of the liberall Arts and Sciences, of which ≈øort are Logick, Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, Grammer, and the Mathematicall ≈øciences, all which had their fir≈øt Authours and Inuentors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 19. Wherfore ≈øay you the art of Inuentioner.</p>
               <p>A. To ≈øhew that there is no Inuention without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Inuentioner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 20. Why then it ≈øeemeth that all Arts, ≈øciences, my≈øteries, trades, crafts, things and deui≈øes, which are now extant in the common-wealth, are, and may bee called Inuentions.</p>
               <p>A. Yea verily ≈øo they may, if wee re≈øpect the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentioner, and fir≈øt Authors of them, but if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect the per≈øons that v≈øe and put in practize the ≈øaid Inuentions at the ≈øecond hand, as we ≈øay, ≈øuch as are the Artificers, Trade≈ømen and others that make the ≈øaid Mechanick workes, in re≈øpect of the≈øe ≈øecondary per≈øons they are called Arts, Trades, Crafts, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, Mi≈øteries, Occupations, Profe≈ø≈øions, and ≈ølightes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So the printing, as al≈øo the Pre≈ø≈øe, the Paper, the Characters, together with the works done, as impre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, bookes, and vollumes, in re≈øpect of <hi>Fau≈øtus</hi> are his Inuention, but in re≈øpect of Printers, which now
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18513:35"/>a dayes worke by his inuention, Printing is rightly called an arte, trade, or mi≈øtery, the like may bee ≈øaid of all other Mechanicall trades now extant in the common-wealth, and of all other profitable inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which here-after may be brought to light in the common-wealth.</p>
               <p>R. 21. To what v≈øe ≈øerueth the knowledge of this.</p>
               <p>A. This fitly ≈øerueth to refute the erronious folly of ≈øuch ≈øhallow ≈øimple per≈øons, which cannot abide any new inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, which this our age bringeth forth, they vtterly di≈øta≈øte both the proiects and Inuentors, they for≈øooth (as they ≈øay) will giue no a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, they will not meddle nor deale with them, they will not v≈øe their new worke, though neuer ≈øo good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, nay they ≈øay more, after their fond fa≈øhion, it will neuer prooue good, or come to pa≈ø≈øe, with a hundred ≈øuch like ≈øpeeches, tending to the di≈øprai≈øe both of the Inuentioner, and of things deui≈øed by him, but being demanded for their rea≈øon, they haue none to alleadge, except onely a womans rea≈øon, like vnto that of the Epigrammati≈øt:
<q>
                     <l>Non amo te <hi>Volu≈øi,</hi> non po≈ø≈øum dicere quare,</l>
                     <l>Hoc tantum po≈øsum dicere, non amo te.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But if the≈øe men, who ≈øo much ≈øpurne at inuentions, did well con≈øider, that all ancient Mechanick trades, occupations, profe≈ø≈øions and workes, which now are in v≈øe in the common-wealth, were new at the fir≈øt, and had their beginning and infancy, and how they

If I ≈øay they did well, con≈øider and ponder this, they would not be ≈øo auer≈øe and bitter again≈øt laudable, and good proiects, brought forth now a dayes, for with as good rea≈øon they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh again≈øt printing, ≈øhipping, milning and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, again≈øt the ordinary waies of making of ≈øalts, alloms, coppre≈ø≈øes, and ≈øaultpeeter, again≈øt the trade and art of making of hats, and knit-≈øtockings, ≈øhooes, bootes, and apparell, again≈øt the art and trade of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ≈øaddles, carts, ploughes, harrowes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the art of melting, founding, and ca≈øting of mettles, of forging, hammering, and battering of irons, bra≈ø≈øe, peuters, ≈øiluer, and gould; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again≈øt all other trades, occupations, vocations, and profe≈ø≈øions in the common-wealth, as ≈øo ba≈øely to regard and e≈øteeme the proffitable and new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions of our daies. Againe, in ≈øcorning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of profitable bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of late inuention, they ≈øet them≈øelues not onely again≈øt man, but al≈øo again≈øt the ≈øpirit of God, who is the authour of the ≈øaid gifts, and fir≈øt worke of them in man, as it is expre≈ø≈øely taught in the 31. of <hi>Exodus:</hi> in the example of two worthy inuentioners, and artificers, the wordes of the text are the≈øe. Behold (≈øaith God to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>) I haue called by name <hi>Bezaleele</hi> the ≈øonne of <hi>Vri,</hi> the ≈øonne of <hi>Hur,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> whom I haue filled with the ≈øpirit of God in wi≈øedome and

               <p>Out of which words of holy Scripture it is apparent that all Mechanicke Arts and Inuentions, as well as the graces of ≈øaluation, are the peculiar workes, and gifts of Gods holy ≈øpirit in man, which bloweth where, and when he li≈øteth, and powreth out his ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, vpon ≈øome men in euery age.</p>

               <p>YOu haue handled the doctrine of the generall meanes and In≈øtruments of Inuentions, proceed I pray you to ≈øpeake of the differences and diuers kindes of Inuentions, and Fir≈øt therefore I de≈øire to know.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:18513:40"/>
               <p> R. 45. How many ≈øorts or kindes of Inuention are there being compared or con≈øidered one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?</p>
               <p>A. Two, An Inuention is either pure or intermixt, an Inuention is ≈øaid to bee pure and entire within it ≈øelfe, when as none of the parts e≈ø≈øentiall are common to any other Inuention for the ≈øame v≈øe.</p>
               <p>Intermixt when as ≈øome of the parts are found in ≈øome other former inuention.</p>
               <p>So a Windmill is an intermixt Inuention, becau≈øe ≈øome of the partes, as namely the Milne ≈øtones, the rong-wheeles and the Cogg-wheeles were fir≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in awater-milne or hor≈øe-milne and quernes.</p>
               <p>But a hand-Querne was a pure and ≈øimple Inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on becau≈øe none of the parts there of were formerly extant in any other Mechanick.</p>
               <p>And ≈øo printing is a pure and ≈øimple Inuention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe none of the e≈ø≈øentiall parts thereof were taken from any former Inuention, where they were appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ≈øame v≈øe.</p>
               <p>Where note that the common parts of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt Inuention are to be e≈øteemed as propper and peculiar to the ≈øame Inuention, when as they are conioyned and mixed in with other new things In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and meanes, which are the e≈ø≈øentiall parts of the new deui≈øe.</p>
               <p>R. 46. What other di≈øtribution haue you of an in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uention in re≈øpect of magnitude.</p>
               <p>A. In re≈øpect of greatne≈ø≈øe or quantity, there are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18513:41"/>three ≈øorts of inuentions, namely the Moddle, the Protopla≈øt, and the grand Mechanick.</p>
               <p>R. 47. De≈øcribe the Moddle.</p>
               <p>A. The Moddle is a Mechanick, which onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øenteth and decyphereth, in ≈øome little platforme, the true part and lineaments of the Mechanick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, beeing in≈øufficient to yeeld any Emporeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick v≈øe of the inuention.</p>
               <p>So the Moddle of a winde-milne, repre≈øenteth the failes and other parts of Fabrick and ≈øtructure, but grindeth no corne.</p>
               <p>Where note, that ≈øome times the moddle is to be made greater then the Mechanick, e≈øp ecially in ≈ømall curious things, as in a watch, and ≈øuch like.</p>
               <p>R. 48. How many ≈øorts of moddles are there.</p>
               <p>A. Two, Superficiall and Reall.</p>
               <p>The Superficiall de≈øcribeth onely the parts and line aments in paper, bordes or pa≈øt-bords, by lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, drawing, or painting, ≈øhewing no action or opperation, nor corporall dimen≈øions of the parts.</p>
               <p>A Reall moddle is that which ≈øheweth euery part of the greater Mechanick, in a true and liuely (though little) proportion, hauing his parts fitted for motion, action, or opperation: Neuerthele≈ø≈øe it is not ≈øo effectuall or fully v≈øe-full, beeing onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentatiue, as was touched before.</p>
               <p>So a little ≈øhip, which you haue hanging vp in a marchants hou≈øe, is the Reall moddle of a grand ≈øhip or ≈øea ve≈ø≈øell, becau≈øe it repre≈øenteth euery part and action thereof.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:18513:41"/>
               <p> R. 49. What is the principall v≈øe of a Reall Mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
               <p>A. The cheefe≈øt v≈øe of a reall moddle is that the Inuention may thereby more perfectly and exactly direct both him≈øelfe, and al≈øo guide his workmen for the fini≈øhing of any grander Mechanick of the ≈øame kind, thereby the better to produce and bring forth the Theorick conceiued in his mind into the grand Reall Inuention.</p>
               <p>So the v≈øe of a ≈ømall reall moddle of a Wind-milne ≈øerueth uery fitly to direct both the Inuentor him≈øelfe and likewi≈øe all his Carpenters and other workmen, to proceed infallibly to build and ≈øet vp a reall and grand windmilne intended to be made.</p>
               <p>R. 50. How many ≈øorts of reall moddles are there.</p>
               <p>A. There are two ≈øorts, for either they are meerely directionall or al≈øo motionall.</p>
               <p>Directionall is that moddle which is made only to direct and guide the Artificer in the dimen≈øions of all the parts, as al≈øo for to direct them for the kinds of the matter and the ≈øtuffe that they are to haue to make the engin intended.</p>
               <p>R. 51. What is the fitte≈øt and cheape≈øt ≈øtuffe to make a directionall moddle of.</p>
               <p>A. Pa≈øt-boordes and reedes are the fitte≈øt either for Iron-works or woodworks, wherof the Pa≈øt-bords are in ≈øtead of boordes, plancks and bed-≈øides.</p>
               <p>And the Reeds are to repre≈øent round Cylindriack timber, as al≈øo other ≈øquare timber, as namely ≈øingle
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18513:42"/>quarters, double quarters, puncheons, rafters, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øummes &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that of the≈øe the Inuentioner may fitly and ≈øpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily make and contriue the fabricke and ≈øtructure of any directionall moddle.</p>
               <p>R. 52. What call you a motionall moddle.</p>
               <p>A. A motionall is that moddle Reall which is made compleat in euery part, hauing his true v≈øe, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration and motion, as in the grander <hi>Mechanickes,</hi> yet hauing no Emporeuticke commodity, but onely for ≈øhew and tryall, and not for ≈øale and v≈øe.</p>
               <p>There are three degrees in this motionall moddle, the meane moddle, the le≈ø≈øer then the meane, the greater then the meane.</p>
               <p>The meane moddle is a motionall, which hath his magnitude and greatne≈ø≈øe betweene the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, being the lea≈øt chargeable to be made. And it is alwaies greater then the le≈ø≈øer motionall, and le≈ø≈øer then the greater motion all: and there is but one meane modle to be found in the progre≈ø≈øio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of the ≈øame degres</p>
               <p>Where note that it belongeth principally to the Inuentioners skil and care to ≈øet forth the dimen≈øions and parts of his moddle, intended with the lea≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of charges that may be, and in the ea≈øie≈øt and redie≈øt manner for his workemen to vnder≈øtand and imitate, or el≈øe he hitteth not vpon the meane mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but vpon ≈øome other extreame.</p>
               <p>R. 53. Define the Protopla≈øt.</p>
               <p>A. The Protopla≈øt is an Inuention mechanick which fir≈øt is ≈øet vp of that kind, and ≈øeruing to profitable
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18513:42"/>Emporeuticke v≈øes, hauing all the principall parts, actions, and perfections, which all other ≈øub≈øequent grand Mechanicks ought to haue of the ≈øame kinde, which afterward are to be made and framed by it.</p>
               <p>So the fir≈øt windmilne that the inuentioner euer ≈øet vp to grinde corne was the Protopla≈øt and example from whence all other wind-milnes ≈øprange and were deriued, the like may bee ≈øaid of the fir≈øt of euery kinde of Mechanicke, as of <hi>Faustus</hi> his fir≈øt Printing Pre≈ø≈øe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>R. 54. Define a grand Mechanicke.</p>
               <p>A. The grand Mechanicke, is that which is ≈øet vp after the forme and tipe of his Protopla≈øt, for the ≈øame v≈øe and purpo≈øe, onely differing from the Protopla≈øt in greatne≈ø≈øe, or with ≈øome profitable additions which later experience hath taught.</p>
               <p>So the Windmilnes in More-fields are Mechanicks of that kinde of inuention, for they are builded after the Archerype of the Protopla≈øt which the inuentor fir≈øt inuented and erected, ≈øeruing to the ≈øame v≈øe of grinding of corne; they differ onely in this, they haue a deui≈øe called the Crampe, which will ≈øodenly ≈øtay (in the face of the ≈øtorme) the violent motion or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumgyration of the wheeles, vntill the ≈øales are taken downe or fardled vp.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heterocre≈øious,</hi> are inuentions which produce diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Mechanick workes, wares and commodities. So milning and ≈øhipping are two <hi>Heterocre≈øious</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, becau≈øe the worke of the one is meale or flower, and the worke of the other is carriage or tran≈øportage.</p>
               <p>R. 56. Define <hi>Homocre≈øious</hi> Inuentions.</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Homocre≈øious</hi> inuentions, are ≈øuch which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and bring forth Emporeuticall workes for the ≈øame v≈øe.</p>
               <p>So a hor≈øe-milne, a water milne, a wind-milne are <hi>Homocre≈øious,</hi> becau≈øe they all grinde flower, though after different manner and wayes.</p>
               <p>R. 57. What di≈øtribution haue you for <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre≈øious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. An Inuention <hi>Homocre≈øious,</hi> is either primatiue or deriuatiue, the primatiue is that which was the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18513:43"/>fir≈øt in v≈øe in the world of the ≈øame kinde.</p>
               <p>So a Pe≈øtle and a Morter is a primatiue inuention, becau≈øe it was fir≈øt v≈øed for to beat and bru≈øe corne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to meale and powder, and at this day it is ≈øtill v≈øed to grinde eaten grotes, but a hand-querne, a hor≈ø-milne, a winde-milne, and a water-milne, are Inuentions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuatiue, all which were found out in ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of time, long after the pe≈øtle and the mortar.</p>
               <p>R. 58. Giue ≈øome other illu≈øtrious examples of primatiue and deriuatiue inuentions.</p>
               <p>A. In matters of literature, the Art of writing with the pen, is a worthy primatiue inuention, both for writing and reading, found out by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> that learned Leuite and thrice holy Prophet, the deriuatiue inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof is Printing, a far more exqui≈øite mi≈øtery deui≈øed of late yeares by <hi>Fau≈øtus Guttenbergius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in husbandry the Spade, the Rake, and Shouell, was a worthy primatiue inuention of <hi>Adam,</hi> for the tillage and ≈øowing of the ground, according to that ancient and old prouerbe.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>When <hi>Adam</hi> digged, and <hi>Eue</hi> ≈øpan,</l>
                  <l>Who was then a Gentleman.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But the Plough and the Harrow are their deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue inuentions, which for the v≈øes of husbandry doe farre exceed them, for by them more worke of tillage of the ground may be done in one day with the ≈øame charge, then could be done by their primatiue inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in twenty dayes.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:18513:44"/>
               <p> Againe the Barrow which carrieth burdens from places is a primatiue inuention, but the Cart with wheeles is a far more excellent deriued Mechanick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it carrieth more in one day, then the primatiue can doe in ten dayes with the ≈øame charges.</p>
               <p>And this Inuention of round wheeles to draw and carry loades with a ≈ømall ≈øtrength vndoubtedly was grounded on this Geometricall <hi>axiom, Circulus tangit planum vnico puncto,</hi> for if the wheeles ≈øhould haue beene made ≈øquare, trencher wi≈øe, or in any other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-angle, forty hor≈øes would not ≈øo ea≈øily draw them beeing laden, as two doth now with both ≈øpeed and ea≈øe. And thus much for the example of primatiue and deriuatiue Inuentions.</p>
               <p>Where note, that the deriuatiue mu≈øt alwayes bee of a greater v≈øe, and doe more good in the common wealth, then the primatiue, or el≈øe it is not to bee receiued.</p>
               <p>Note al≈øo, if there be many deriuatiues in the ≈øame kinde, the latter inuention mu≈øt alwayes better the former, and beeing all of them compared and ranck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their primatiue, they make an Inuentionall progre≈ø≈øion, one exceeding an other, in goodne≈ø≈øe and v≈øe, among≈øt which, the la≈øt of all ought to bee the be≈øt, and is therefore called the Eumechanick in the progre≈ø≈øion of that kinde.</p>
               <p>R. 59. Giue ≈øome examples of Inuentionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øion.</p>

               <p>To which if we adde the inuention of the Plegnick Milne, it maketh vp the ≈øixt, and is the Eumechanick of that kinde.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in ho≈øe or ≈øtockings, there is a progre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of three, cloth or ker≈øey ≈øtockings, which were fir≈øt in v≈øe: Secondly in knit ≈øtockings with Needles: Thirdly, and la≈øtly, in knit ≈øtockings with loome, which is a late Inuention of one Mai≈øter <hi>Lee.</hi>

               <p>All inuentions, for the mo≈øt part, of latter times, are deriuatiue, &amp; the Inuentioners are to make choice of this kinde, and needeth the le≈ø≈øe to ≈øpend his time about any primatiue deuice.</p>

               <p>But the flower and meale thus ground and made by the windemilne <hi>Engin</hi> is fitly called the inuention emporeuticall.</p>
               <p>So likewi≈øe the whole ≈øtructure and complement of all the permanent, and imper≈øonall in≈øtruments, and meanes which make vp the Ferricall furnace, is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the inuention.</p>
               <p>R. 61. What differences haue you for the parts of an Inuention <hi>Organicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The parts of an inuention <hi>Organicall,</hi> are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther e≈ø≈øentiall or ine≈ø≈øentiall, comon or peculiar <hi>Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall.</hi>

               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:18513:45"/>
               <p> But the earth-coale iron which is made by the ≈øaid complement, and panoply of in≈øtruments is fitly called the Emporeuticall inuention of the Author or Inuentor.</p>
               <p>R. 62. De≈øcribe the e≈ø≈øentiall parts of an inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Organicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The e≈ø≈øentiall part of an inuention <hi>Organicall</hi> is any maine and chiefe member, whereby the engin is well enabled to performe his worke and operation, which being lacking, the other parts of the engin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ineffectuall, and inoperatiue, for the producing the <hi>Emporeuticke</hi> intended.</p>
               <p>So a windmilne con≈øi≈øteth of all hise≈ø≈øential parts, be≈øides his cro≈ø≈øe ≈øales is ineffectuall and not able to grinde corne, the like may be ≈øaid if it lacke a cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheele, a ronge wheele, a milne-≈øtone, or any other e≈ø≈øentiall part.</p>
               <p>R. 63. De≈øcribe an ine≈ø≈øentiall part of an Inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Organicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. An ine≈ø≈øentiall part is an additament, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede ≈øomewhat bettereth and helpeth the Inuention, when it is added to the maine complement of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi> or <hi>Engin,</hi> yet being lacking and not v≈øed, it taketh not away the opperation or worke of the inuention or engin: of this ≈øort, is the crampe of a windmilne, which is a very good and worthy addittament, found out by ≈øome ingenious Milner of late, and it is able to hold the cro≈ø≈øe ≈øales immoueable, euen in the very bla≈øt of a ≈øtorme.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:18513:46"/>
               <p> Yet wind-milnes which haue not nor had not this later addition of the crampe doe daily grinde corne a≈øwell as other wind-milnes which are there withall furni≈øhed.</p>
               <p>But in a ≈øtorme they are driuen to this inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: that three or foure mu≈øt pre≈øently goe downe to turne their cro≈ø≈øe failes out of the winde, that they may take downe and fardle vp their ≈øailes.</p>
               <p>So likewi≈øe the bra≈ø≈øe plate and the rouling girth are nece≈ø≈øarie and conuenient additions in the engin of the Printing Pre≈ø≈øe, and both of them were of late yeares fir≈øt deui≈øed (as it is ≈øaid) by one Mai≈øter <hi>Haruie</hi> an ingenious Printer in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>

               <p>R. 64 De≈øcribe the common parts of an inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Organicall.</p>
               <p>The common parts are ≈øuch as are borrowed from other trades, occupations and mi≈øteries formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented and in v≈øe, and now adioyned and mixed in, among≈øt the new parts of the Inuention.</p>
               <p>R. 65. What call you the peculiar parts of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention.</p>
               <p>A. The peculiar parts are ≈øuch as are proper and of the e≈ø≈øence of the inuention, not being taken from any other Mechanicke, formerly in v≈øe.</p>
               <p>So the ≈øayles, the milne-po≈øt, the ≈øpurs of a wind-milne are his peculiar parts, but the cogge-wheeles,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18513:46"/>ronge-wheeles, and milne≈øtones are common parts as being a≈ø≈øumed and borrowed from the hor≈øe-milne and water-milne formerly in v≈øe.</p>

               <p>R. 69. What call you Theoricke Inuention.</p>
               <p>A. The Theoricke of an inuention is the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the contents thereof by a plaine and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar di≈øcription, and that either by manu≈øcript
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18513:47"/>writings or by printed treati≈øes.</p>

               <p>A. The arguments of the parts and adiuncts, or the Arguments of In≈øtruments and meanes.</p>
               <p>R. 71. Do the parts, and adiuncts, and In≈øtruments, and meanes, expre≈ø≈øe diuers meanes.</p>
               <p>A. No, for by parts and adiuncts are vnder≈øtood the ≈øelfe ≈øame things, which are meant by in≈øtruments and meanes, but yet in diuers and different re≈øpects: for they are called parts and adiuncts in re≈øpect that the Mechanick Engin ≈øub≈øi≈øteth &amp; con≈øi≈øteth of them, but in re≈øpect of the Emporeutick, which is made by them, the ≈øaid partes and adiuncts are fitly called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruments and meanes.</p>
               <p>So a printing Pre≈ø≈øe hath his ≈øeuerall parts, whervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it doth con≈øi≈øt, as the ≈øcrew, the nut, the pare-tree and the cha≈øe, &amp;c. it hath al≈øo his adiuncts belonging to it, as the Inck and the Inck-bals &amp;c. which ≈øaid parts and adiuncts of the Pre≈ø≈øe con≈øidered, with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted papers, bookes and impre≈ø≈øions which are the ≈øale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Emporeutick workes.

               <p>R 72. Define a practick of an Inuention.</p>

               <p>R. 73. What cannons haue you of an inuention in re≈øpect of the Theorick.</p>

               <p>A. An inuention tryable is either conformeable or inconformeable.</p>
               <p>R. 78. Define a conformeable inuention.</p>
               <p>A. A conformeable inuention is an inuention try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able which reformeth and bettereth a former inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (requiring but ≈øome ≈ømall and not chargeable alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) after that the new is vnited to the ould.</p>

               <p>R. 79. What Cannons or rules haue you for a conformeable inuention.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:18513:48"/>
               <p> A.

               <p>A. An inconformable inuention requireth a great ≈øtocke and great disbur≈øements for the Pattentees,

               <p>R. 82. What other di≈øtribution haue you for an inuention Mechanicke.</p>
               <p>A. An inuention Mechanicke, is either priuiledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or vnpriuiledged, againe it is either a royaltie or a coppy-hould.</p>
               <p>A royaltie is ≈øuch a new bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, which in regard of the greatne≈ø≈øe thereof belongeth peculiarly to the King.</p>
               <p>Or a royaltie is an inuention Mechanicke which produceth extraordinarie and worthie yearely profits and reuenewes, who≈øe valuation exceedeth the ≈øumme of ten thou≈øand pounds. <hi>per annum.</hi>

               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:18513:50"/>
               <p> A. There are many infallible Rules by which if a diriuatiue Inuention be examined, wee may ea≈øily iudge of the goodne≈ø≈øe thereof, but to reduce this doctrine to ≈øome head, we are to con≈øider both the generall vertues, and generall faults in inuentions.</p>
               <p>R. 88. What are the generall virtues by which an Inuention is to be examined.</p>
               <p>The vertues of an Inuention are of two degrees, the le≈ø≈øer and the greater, and each degree is three-fould.</p>
               <p>R. 89. Which are the le≈ø≈øer virtues of a deriuatiue Inuention.</p>
               <p>A. The≈øe three, Equi ≈øufficiencie, Equi-cheapenes, Equi excellency.</p>
               <p>R. 90. What meane you by Equi-≈øufficiencie.</p>
               <p>A. Equall ≈øufficiencie is when the new Inuention or Emporeuticke is as ≈øufficient and as good for v≈øe as the ould.</p>
               <p>So Printed bookes are as ≈øufficient and as good to reade as written Manu≈øcripts, and the meale grinded by the winde-milne, is as good and ≈øufficient to make bread as that which is grinded by the water-milnes, and earthen pipes by the Pre≈ø≈øorian Art, being well made are as ≈øtrong to hould and conuey water as leaden pipes or potters pots, which two kindes of water conueiances werein v≈øe long before pre≈ø≈øe-ware pipes were inuented.</p>
               <p>R. 91. What meane you by the ≈øecond virtue which you cal equi-cheapene≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>A. The new Emporeuticke is ≈øaid to haue equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheapenes,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18513:50"/>cheapenes, when as it may be ≈øould and vttered as cheape as the ould commoditie or inuention which was in v≈øe before.</p>
               <p>So if Printing bookes be but as cheape to be ≈øould as manu≈øcript bookes, then they are ≈øaid to haue equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheapenes.</p>
               <p>And if Tiles made by the Pre≈ø≈øorian Art may bee afforded to be ≈øould and vttered as cheape as the tiles made by the ould and ordinary way, then the Pre≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware Tiles may well be ≈øaid to haue Equi cheapenes with ordinary Tiles.</p>
               <p>R. 92. What meane you by the third virtue which you call Equi-excellency.</p>
               <p>A. The new Inuention is ≈øaid to haue Equi-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie with the ould, when it hath in it the ≈øame beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and perfection that the ould commodity of ≈øale hath, and in the ≈øame degree, mea≈øure and equallitie.</p>

               <p>R. 97. What is the fir≈øt Cannon.</p>
               <p>A. If an Emporeutick haue only in it all the ≈ømal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vertues, although it may be e≈øteemed commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a new inuention, then ≈øurely it will do no good to be ≈øet vp and followed:</p>

               <p>R 98. What is your ≈øecond Cannon to iudge of the worthle≈ø≈øne≈ø≈øe of an Inuention.</p>
               <p>A. If a new Inuention of ≈øale haue in it but all the ≈ømaller faults only, it is not to be commended nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer will prooue good, for example, if one ≈øhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui≈øe a Water-worke, to rai≈øe waters, which is le≈ø≈øe

               <p>R. 99. What is the third directory Cannon.</p>
               <p>A. If a new inuention, compared with the old, be found to haue in it but one of the grander faults, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be accompanied with ≈øome one or two of the grand, vertues, yet is it to be reiected for ≈øtarke naught, for there can no good be made of it, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance ≈øake ≈øay that one hath deui≈øed to make window<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the pure mettle of Venice-gla≈ø≈øe, or of the pure ≈øub≈øtance of Chri≈øtall, which is not impo≈ø≈øible to be done, This his ≈øale Mechanick will be exceeding deere and co≈øtly, And therefore although it be more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or ≈øtronger, or more ≈øufficient then the ordinary kind of windowing by greene gla≈ø≈øe, yet the Inuentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will neuer do good of it, except it bee to begger him≈øelfe, and all that ≈øhall deale in it: for a ≈øcrap of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquintida, I ≈øay, marreth a whole me≈ø≈øe of good pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>

               <p>This la≈øt triplicity although it hath two good grand vertues, yet the buyers of this Emporeutick will not deale with it, becau≈øe they cannot abide to behold it.</p>
               <p>R. 101. What other triplicities are there of this Cannon.</p>
               <p>A. Three by one grand vertue, and three by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which for breuities ≈øake I omit.</p>
               <p>R. 102. What other Cannons haue you to iudge of the worthle≈ø≈øne≈ø≈øe of an Inuention.</p>
               <p>A. If an Inuention containe all the grander ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and yet tend to the vtter confu≈øion of Kingdoms and Ciuill E≈øtates, then is it by no meanes to bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted or enterprized by any Inuentioner, Of this kind is the <hi>Inuention to walk inui≈øible,</hi> if ≈øuch a deuice may be attained vnto, <hi>to make a barge or ≈øhip</hi> to flye as well in the ayre as to ≈øaile vpon the water.</p>
               <p>R. 103. What Cannons or Rules haue you to iudge of the goodne≈ø≈øe and worth of a deriuatiue Inuention.</p>
               <p>A There are many Cannons likewi≈øe for this purpo≈øe, all which are grounded vpon triplicities of the former vertues or le≈ø≈øer faultes, or intermixt of both.</p>
               <p>R. 104. What is the fir≈øt Cannon.</p>
               <p>A. An Inuention that hath none of the grand faults and hath at the lea≈øt one of the grand vertues, or more in his triplicity, then is it to be e≈øteemed good and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable as it apeareth by al the≈øe ≈øub≈øequent triplicities.</p>

               <p>R. 121. How many kindes of Plegnicke in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be there.</p>
               <p>A. There are fiue kindes of Plegnicke engins or Machins, the Plegnicke <hi>Bellowes,</hi> the Plegnicke <hi>Milne</hi> the Plegnicke <hi>Schrew,</hi> and the Plegnicke <hi>Rombus,</hi> and the <hi>Reciprocall</hi> Plegnicke.</p>

               <p>A. There are many differences, fir≈øt the Plegnicke bellowes is more hand≈øomely and ≈øtrongly made, then ordinary refining bellowes, and with farre le≈ø≈øe expence of leather, for here the leather is not clo≈øely nailed vpon the wood, but ≈øtrongly gra≈øted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into the very ≈øub≈øtance of the timber, ≈øo that by this meanes the ioytning of the leather and the wood together, is as thite and clo≈øe as the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18513:59"/>of the boords them≈øelues.</p>
               <p>Secondly the Plegnick bellowes may be made to blow and ≈øtreame forth not only could wind and ayre (which is all that ordinary bellowes can doe) but al≈øo to blow and ≈øend forth flames of fire, water, vapours and du≈øt, all which is very nece≈ø≈øary for the blowing of <hi>Metallicque</hi> ≈øub≈øtances, as ≈øhall be at large ≈øhewed in the ≈øecond Edition or in the Appendix called Pleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the Plegnick bellowes may ≈øo be made and contriued, to blow ten times more then the ordinary bellowes, and that either by moouing ten times fa≈øter, or el≈øe by being made ten times greater.</p>
               <p>R. 123. What odds and prerogatiue differences is there betweene the ordinary Milnes and your new deui≈øed Plegnick Milnes.</p>
               <p>A. The Plegnick Milnes haue many prerogatiues and conueniences which the ordinary Milning lacketh: and to begin with the Wind milne.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Fir≈øt the ordinary Wind-milne hath nor only his ≈øailes mounted vp in the wind, but al≈øo the work-hou≈øe wherin the Milne-≈øtones and the Cogg-wheeles grind the corne, by which meanes they are ≈øubiect to bee blowne downe with ≈øtormes, but the Plegnick Wind-milne hath his worke-hou≈øe vpon the firme ground, by meanes whereof you may make your Roomes as wide and as large as you will without any hazard or danger of blowing downe.</item>
                  <item>Secondly the cro≈ø≈øe ≈øailes of the Wind-milne doe mooue <hi>verte callter,</hi> as they cal it, or through the <hi>ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:18513:59"/>or the <hi>nader;</hi> wherevppon ari≈øeth this inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the Wind-milne mu≈øt be turned and haled about continually as the wind changeth, but the Pleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Wind-milne hath his cro≈ø≈øe-≈øailes ouer the top of the work-hou≈øe, and they flye round about with a circular motion, paralel to the <hi>Horizon:</hi> whereby it is ready for all windes without turning or haling about.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly this Plegnick deui≈øe may be made to go with three or foure paire of Milne-≈øtones at once, whereas the wind-milne can go only but with one paire, and by this meanes the Plegnick Wind-milne will grind three or foure times more meale in an houre, e≈øpecially in a good gale of wind.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly the Wind-milne grindeth only corne, and cannot be made to do any other worke, as the water-milne doth, but the Plegnick engin doth all manner of workes, it will grind corne as well as the Wind-milne, it will ≈øerue for the Iron furnace to blow the bellowes as well as the ordinary Water-milne, and finally to do any other worke which the Water-milne or Hor≈øe-milne doth.</item>
                  <item>Fiftly the Wind milne ≈øtandeth ≈øtill in a calme and when the wind ≈øerueth not, for there is no meanes to make it goe but by wind, but the Plegnick milne is perpetuall, for when the wind ≈øerueth not, it is made to go with hor≈øe, and in a ≈ømall gale of wind the hor≈øe may help to draw and mooue it fa≈øter.</item>
                  <item>Sixtly there are al≈øo many other conueniences in the Plegnick Water-milne ouer and aboue the ordinary water milne as more at large ≈øhall bee ≈øhewed in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18513:60"/>≈øecond edition of this treati≈øe.</item>
               </list>
               <p>R. 124. How many ≈øorts of Plegnick milnes are there in regard of the force that mooueth the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
               <p>There are fiue ≈øorts of Plegnick milnes, The fir≈øt is called the Hor≈øwin becau≈øe it mooueth both with hor≈øe and wind, the ≈øecond kind is called the <hi>Hor≈øewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> becau≈øe it goeth both by hor≈øe and water, The third kind is called the <hi>windwater,</hi> becau≈øe the Wind and the water mooueth the engin ioyntly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The fourth kind is called the <hi>Hor≈øwinwater</hi> becau≈øe it is mooued with hor≈øe, wind and water alltogether, and at one time. The fi≈øt kind is called the <hi>water Pleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> which mooueth either inui≈øibly and ≈øecretly vnder the water and by the water with one rong wheele or elce with two Horizontall wheeles aboue the water.</p>
               <p>R. 125. Did you euer make any of the≈øe Plegnick milnes to experiment their goodne≈ø≈øe by triall.</p>
               <p>A. I haue made diuers milne engins to go both by wind and water, in the moddle, but not in the grand Mechanick, and I haue at this pre≈øent a hor≈øwin now framing at Highbury, which the next terme God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ≈øhall ≈øtand vppon ≈øome Turret in London neere vnto the Thames ≈øide, where all pa≈ø≈øengers by water may ≈øee it goe and mooue continually.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18513:60"/>is de≈øirous to ≈øee it may haue it there at a ≈øhip-Carpenters yard vppon the Wharfe. And thus much of the Plegnick milne.</p>
               <p>R. 126. Define the Plegnick Screw, the Plegnick Rhombus, and the reciprocall Plegnick, which are the three la≈øt kinds of your Plegnick Engins.</p>
               <p>A. The plegnick ≈øcrew is an engin who≈øe ≈øpirall line mooueth with one motion, two vice nutts or Matrixes at the ≈øame time, which no other ≈øcrew did before, This plegnick ≈øcrew is very auaileable in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallicall</hi> workes, aboue any other ordinary ≈øcrew, which hath beene v≈øually in the common wealth, but e≈øpecially it is very conuenient for tempering, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and impa≈øtening of all kind of oares and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coales</p>
               <p>The plegnick Rhombus is an Engin of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and admirable power and faculty, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of quick and ≈øpeedy motion there was neuer any Machin yet deui≈øed, which commeth neere vnto it.</p>
               <p>The Reciprocall Plegnick is an Engin that hath wheeles running reciprocally, turning back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forewards by one great wheele that mooueth but one way at the ≈øame time which kind of reciprocal motion was neuer done or performed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by any other Engin.</p>
               <p>This reciprocall is of great v≈øe for the battering and beating of Iron, lattin, plate, copper, or any other mettles.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Turffe</hi> and <hi>Peate</hi> maketh a third kinde of earth-coale, and if they haue any ≈øulpharou≈øne≈ø≈øe in them, it is not ≈øo heauy and fretting as that which is in the Sea-coale and Stone-coale, the Low-countries v≈øe for the mo≈øt part this kinde of fewell, in≈øteed of wood &amp; ≈øea-coale.</p>
               <p>Bru≈øh-fewell is the third kind of firing, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the inward ≈øub≈øtance of the earth, nor of the vpper ≈øuperficies as Sea-coale and Turffe is, but grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon the earth in a bru≈øhie or twiggie manner, of this ≈øort is all kinde of ≈øtubble, Baueings, Straw, Furs, Fearne, Ling, Heath, with other ≈øtalkes, of hearbes,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18513:62"/>weeds, and vnder-≈øhrubs, all which burne with great flames, yet are they of no great heate or long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. Vnder Bru≈øh-fewell, wee comprehend al≈øo an other ≈øort, which is not ≈øo much v≈øed for firing, as for lights, as namely, oyles, tallowes, waxes, which are v≈øed in lampes and candles. Secondly, pitch, ro≈ø≈øen, turpentine, tarre, ma≈øtick, with ≈øuch like liquids and gums, as i≈ø≈øue and proceed from trees beeing combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtible. This kind of fewell is mo≈øt fit for the <hi>Ventignoll</hi> Mechanick, which hath good and profitable v≈øe for many purpo≈øes, where other fewell is not ≈øo fit.</p>
               <p>R. 131. What meanes are to be v≈øed to make earth-coale as ≈øeruiceable for Metalique purpo≈øes, as wood or Char-coale.</p>
               <p>A. There are three ≈øorts, the fir≈øt is to bring earth-coale to that equallity of heat, that wood or charcoale hath, that is to ≈øay, that it maketh neither hotter nor coulder fire then wood or Charcoale doth: the ≈øecond meanes, is ≈øo to order and prepare pit-coale, that all nociue proprieties, which are aver≈ø≈øe from all Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ≈øub≈øtances, may be ab≈øtracted from it, or at lea≈øt de≈øtroyed in it. The third meanes is the Addition and infu≈øion of tho≈øe deficient proprieties, which as they are in char-cole, ≈øo ought they to be found in pit-cole.</p>
               <p>R. 132. What meane you by <hi>Caminicke-liquores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. By <hi>Caminicke-liquores</hi> I vnder≈øtand diuers kinds of intermixt and compounded waters for the lauing, wa≈øhing and ≈øteeping of all kinde of mettle-Ewres to cau≈øe them the better to yeeld and giue downe their liquid mettle from their ≈ølaggs and cinders.</p>
               <p>So that as the Gould-≈ømith hath his waters which will ≈øegar gould from ≈øiluer, and the Allom-maker his vrines for the ≈øegaring and bringing downe of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomes,

               <p>R. 133. Define a furnace.</p>
               <p>A. A ≈øurnace is a Caminicke in≈øtrument made and built of furnace-earth; or a furnace is the Artificiall receptacle of fier and fewell, for boyling, nealing, and backing of all kinde of Rawe-materials or Rawe-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>R. 134. How many kindes of Rawe-matters are there for furnaces to worke vpon.</p>
               <p>A. There are fiue ≈øorts of Rawe-matters, the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-matter, the liquour-matter, the fiery earth-matter, the dry matter and compounded-matter.</p>
               <p>R. 135. De≈øcribe more plainely the≈øe ≈øeuerall kinds of Rawe-matters.</p>
               <p>A. The Mettle-matter is that Mettellar ≈øub≈øtance which is put into the Furnace to be baked, boyled or nealed, which in one word may be called the Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellar.</p>
               <p>R. 136. How many kindes of <hi>Mettellars</hi> are there</p>
               <p>A. There are three ≈øorts of <hi>Mettellars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fir≈øt is the raw or baked oare, as it is digged out of the earth, which being put into the furnace melteth downe into two ≈øub≈øtances, the one is called the <hi>Gla≈øs-≈ølag,</hi> and th'other the <hi>Sowe-liquour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Gla≈ø≈øe-≈ølage</hi> is a liquid materiall of a gla≈ø≈øie ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance being tough, thicke, and ropy, like bird-lime, it ≈øwimmeth vpon the ≈øuperficies of the ≈øowe liquour, as barme doth vpon beare, or creame vpon milke.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:18513:63"/>
               <p> The ≈øecond kinde of Mettellar is the ≈øowe of Iron which when the hearth or furnace hath receiued it, it melteth downe into two ≈øub≈øtances, whereof one is called <hi>Ferrica ≈øub≈øtantiae,</hi> or the Iron ≈øub≈øtance, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is called the cinder or after-≈ølagg.</p>
               <p>The after-≈ølagg is a liquid materiall which inhereth in the <hi>Ferrica-≈øub≈øtantiae,</hi> as whey doth in a po≈ø≈øet, or crudds.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ferrica-≈øub≈øtantiae</hi> is tougher then the liquour of the alter-≈ølagg, which when it is battred vnder the ≈øtroke and pre≈ø≈øe of the hammer, the after-≈ølagg is ≈øquea≈øed and pre≈ø≈øed out, and ≈øo the <hi>≈øubstance</hi> is made and becometh good Iron, euen as the whey is wrung out by the violence of the Pre≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo the cruds are made into a chee≈øe.</p>
               <p>The third kinde of Mettellar is the could Iron, which when the fordge, furnace or hearth receiueth it, it is nealed and heated into glowing Iron, which glowing Iron afterward is forged by the Smith into diuers Emporeutickes for many-fould v≈øes and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes, as namely into kniues, hor≈øe-≈øhooes, Iron-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, windowe barres, window ca≈øe-ments, and into a thou≈øand ≈øuch like Emporeuticks, whereby Smiths get their liuing and maintenance.</p>
               <p>R. 137. In the definition of your Furnace, you make mention of Furnace-earths, I pray you what meane you by them.</p>
               <p>A. Furnace-earth, is any earthy ≈øub≈øtance, beeing made and prepared of ≈øtone, clay, or lome, that ≈øo it may become the fit and ≈øufficient matter for the <hi>Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Furnace.</p>
               <p>R. 138. How many kindes of Furnace-earths are there where, withall you build vp your Furnaces.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:18513:63"/>
               <p> There are three ≈øorts of Furnace-earths. The fir≈øt is the clay-pipes made of white clay, being tempered, wrought, and impa≈øtned with the du≈øts and pouders of diuers other things. The ≈øecond kinde of Furnace-earth, is the clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my morter, which is of the ≈øame ≈øub≈øtance and temper that the Clay pipes are. The third kinde of Furnace earth, is the Furnace-≈øtone, which is made into diuers figures, formes and proportions by the Pre≈ø≈ø-mould Art, and of the ≈øame matter that the other two kinds were made of before.</p>
               <p>R. 139. Define the ≈øecond kind of Rawe-matters, which you call the Liquour-matter.</p>
               <p>A. The liquor matter is any kind of liquor or liqueable, whether it be cold or hot, which is put into the Furnace Pot, Kettle, Caldron or Copper, to be further heated, and boyled, as namely, all kinds of fatts, tallows, oyles, and all kinds of waters, whether ≈øimple or compound, as fre≈øh-water, Sea-water, Allom≈ø-water, Coppre≈ø≈øe-water, and a thou≈øand ≈øuch kindes of liquours.</p>
               <p>R. 140. Define the third kinde of Rawe-matters which you call fiery-earths.</p>
               <p>A. Fiery-earth is any kind of earth or earthy ≈øub≈øtance be≈øides the Mettler which before was de≈øcribed, as namely all kind of Rawe Pre≈ø≈øe-wares and burnt-earths, before they are burned, baked or nealed, neuerthele≈ø≈øe the Rawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oare if it be but nealed or baked belongeth to this kinde.</p>
               <p>R. 141. Define the fourth kinde of Rawe-matters which you call dry-matters.</p>
               <p>A. Dry-matter is any kinde of Rawe-matter be≈øides the three former which were de≈øcribed before, vnder this head wee comprehend all kinde of pa≈øtes for bread, malts, ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frons, papers, wet cloathes &amp;c.</p>
               <p>R. 142. Define the fift kinde of Rawe-matter which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18513:64"/>you call compounded matter.</p>
               <p>A. Compounded matter is any two or more of the former kindes, comming and i≈ø≈øuing from one furnace and from one fire, together, and at the ≈øame time.</p>
               <p>R. 143. Hauing thus handled and de≈øcribed the ≈øeuerall ≈øorts of Rawe-matters, which are the things that the ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack of the Furnace worketh vpon, labouring to dige≈øt boile, and concoct them, I pray you now proceed to the di≈øtributions of the Frunace.</p>
               <p>A. The Furnace in re≈øpect of the ≈øeuerall kinds of Raw-matters which it boileth and baketh, is likewi≈øe of fiue ≈øorts and kinds, namely the Mettelar-furnace, the liquor-furnace the fier-earth-furnace; the dry-matter-furnace, and the compounded-furnace.</p>
               <p>R. 144. Define the≈øe fiue ≈øeuerall ≈øorts.</p>
               <p>A. The Mettallar-furnace heateth, melteth &amp; nealeth all kind of Mettallers, and ≈øo worketh them into their Empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reutick Materials, vnder this head is comprehended all kind of Iron Furnaces or hearths, for any other kind of mettles.</p>
               <p>The de≈øcriptions of the other foure kindes of furnaces may ea≈øily be gathered by this, and therefore I referre the further explication of them vntill ≈øome other time.</p>
               <p>R. 145. What odds and perogatiue differences are there between the ordinary furnaces which refiners and mettle-founders daily v≈øe, &amp; your new deui≈øed <hi>Caminick</hi> furnaces. A. There are many differences both in regard of the forme &amp; figure of making of them, as al≈øo in re≈øpect of other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences and prerogatiues, whereof the≈øe are principall.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Fir≈øt our <hi>Caminick</hi> Furnace is made and built vp of ≈øuch dureable Furnace-matter, and continually maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ≈øuch fier-re≈øi≈øting meanes, that it cannot po≈ø≈øibly melt or burne down by any <hi>reuerberating</hi> flames or heates what≈øoeuer.</item>
                  <item>2. Secondly, our Caminick Furnace is alwayes built
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18513:64"/>with ≈øome moueable part, as namely the dores, <hi>Fewel-beare, matter-beare</hi> and the <hi>A≈øh-beare,</hi> or any other part as wee plea≈øe.</item>
                  <item>3. Thirdly our <hi>Caminick</hi> Furnace is built vp with gla≈ø≈øe windowes for euery ≈øeuerall roome, ≈øo that thereby the Furnar may continually ≈øee and behold both his Rawe-matters and his Emporeutick Materials, and how his fire and Furnace worketh vpon them, which is a ≈øingular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience which our ordinary Furnaces want.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The≈øe forenamed differences and conueniences, with many others, ≈øhall be truly ≈øhewed and demon≈øtrated in the ≈øeuerall examples of our <hi>Caminick</hi> Furnaces, which very ≈øhortly (God willing) ≈øhall be rai≈øed and built vp at Highbury and at I≈ølington.</p>
               <p>R. 146. What &amp; how many are the generall parts of your furnace, which are to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d in euery kind of your <hi>Camin.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A. There are foure ≈øeuerall roomes, which are to bee found in euery Furnace, the A≈øh-roome, the Fewell-roome, the Matter-roome, and the Vent-holes.</p>
               <p>The a≈øhroome receiueth and holdeth the a≈øhes, the fewell roome, the fewell and firing. The matter-roome receiueth and holdeth the raw-matter. The lower-vent holes receiue and take in the aire, and the vpper vent-holes lets out the ≈ømoake</p>
